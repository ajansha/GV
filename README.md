# GV
GVortex, is an open redirection scanner that is designed to analyze a  domain for open redirection vulnerabilities.GV works by sending a  request to the specified domain and then analyzing the returned headers and  checking for the "Location" field in the response headers. If the location field includes the domain name that's being scanned, GVortex flags it as a potential open redirection vulnerability.
